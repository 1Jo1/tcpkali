    * --latency-marker-skip <N> to ignore the first occurrences of a marker.
    * "Bandwidth per channel:" output line changed to reflect bi-directionâ‡…
    * --listen-mode=active to send data for connections received through -l.
    * Go over 64k connections limit by using IP aliases on network interfaces.
      This is now a default behavior.
    * --source-ip <IP> option to restrict or change source IPs.

0.6:    2015-May-13
    * Parse \{connection.uid} type expressions in
      --first-message, --message, --latency-marker parameters,
      allowing constructing payloads unique per connection.
    * Added "k" multiplier to --connections;
      allowing for a -c10k option (inside joke ;)

0.5:    2015-Apr-14
    * --enable-asan and --enable-tsan flags to enable address/thread sanitizer.

    * -e (--unescape-message-args) now affect --latency-marker string as well.
    * --websocket now awaits response after sending HTTP upgrade headers.
    * Add WebSocket masking on client->server communication (mandated by RFC).
    * Use Boyer-Moore-Horspool to search --latency-marker in the stream.
    * Add --sndbuf and --rcvbuf command line options to adjust kernel buffers
      via setsockopt(SO_*BUF).
    * Record latencies even if only a portion of a message has been sent.

0.4.2:  2015-Feb-23
    * --channel-bandwidth limit is now applicable to sink mode (--listen-port).
